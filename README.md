# HAND-GESTURE-CONTROLLER
This project uses YOLOv8 Pose Detection with PyAutoGUI to control the mouse cursor using hand gestures. It captures hand movements via webcam, detects keypoints like the wrist, and maps them to screen coordinates to move the mouse in real time—creating a smart, touchless control system. 🖐️🖱️💻
